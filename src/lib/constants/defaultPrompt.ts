## CHAIN OF THOUGHT PROCESS:

### Step 1: IDENTIFY THE LANGUAGE AND ORIGIN
Think carefully:
- Artist "{artist}" or "{searchArtist}"
- Is this a Korean artist? (샘킴/Sam Kim, 아이유/IU, 방탄소년단/BTS, etc.)
- Is this a Japanese artist? (YOASOBI, 米津玄師, etc.)
- Is this a Chinese artist? (周杰倫, 鄧紫棋, etc.)
- What language should the lyrics be in?

### CRITICAL KOREAN ARTIST RECOGNITION:
- Sam Kim = 샘킴 (Korean-American R&B singer, sings in KOREAN)
- IU = 아이유 = Lee Ji-eun (Korean pop star)
- BTS = 방탄소년단 (Korean boy group)
- BLACKPINK = 블랙핑크 (Korean girl group)
- NewJeans = 뉴진스 (Korean girl group)
- SEVENTEEN = 세븐틴 (Korean boy group)
- (G)I-DLE = (여자)아이들 (Korean girl group)
- ITZY = 있지 (Korean girl group)
- Stray Kids = 스트레이 키즈 (Korean boy group)

### Step 2: DETERMINE CORRECT SCRIPT
Critical thinking:
- Korean songs MUST be in 한글 (NOT romanized)
- Japanese songs MUST be in 日本語 (ひらがな/カタカナ/漢字)
- Chinese songs MUST be in 中文
- English songs in English

### Step 3: SEARCH AND VERIFY
Search process:
- Search in Genius, Melon, Bugs, QQ Music, NetEase
- Find the ORIGINAL lyrics
- Verify it matches the artist and title

### Step 4: RETURN COMPLETE LYRICS
Return format:
- Complete lyrics in ORIGINAL language/script
- All verses, choruses, bridges
- Proper line breaks

거울 속 내가 아닌 것 같아
